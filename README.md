# Code Review Comments
This page collects common comments made during reviews of code, so that a single detailed explanation can be referred to by everyone. 
This is a laundry list of common mistakes, not a comprehensive style guide. The list may not include issues identified by code analysis tools like linting tool, SonarQube rules, fbinfer or errorprone.info.

Please discuss changes before editing this page, even minor ones. Many people have opinions and this is not the place for edit wars.
Raise a PR with changes all members in the project team will be notified immediately.
