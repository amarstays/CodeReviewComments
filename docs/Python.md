# Python

Pythonic vs None Pythonic. Following are some important items for checklist.

Checklist Item | Category
-------------- | --------
Raising an exception is a primary vehicle for communicating errors in a Python|Error Handling
Subclass built-in exception classes when more precise errors to be propagated upwards|Error Handling
Python programs could be build as OOP or FP. Decide one paradigm to use base on the application|General Programming
Run  loops over collections/enumerations over indexes|General Programming
Use [List Comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)|General Programming
Use tuples and dicts over class with FP|General Programming
Use [Named Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) over tuples|General Programming
use `try` `except` when handling resources instead of checking resource exists|General Programming
Use [Simple Namespace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) instead of classes when colliding variables exists for FP|General Programming
Use finally to release resources. Use `with` statement to handle resources|General Programming
Use [decorators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/) include memoization, locking, pre/post-processing, access control, timing, and many more|General Programming
Use Goose Typing when type checking|General Programming
Try follow same [Zen of Python's](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) designed used for developing python|General Programming
